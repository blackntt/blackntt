I'm a Smart Contract Developer passionate about building secure, efficient, and decentralized applications. My work revolves around creating and auditing smart contracts, primarily for EVM-compatible blockchains.

I also bring a solid back-end development background, allowing me to seamlessly integrate smart contracts with scalable server-side systems and APIs.

Currently, Iâ€™m focused on contributing to Web3 projects, exploring new blockchain use cases, and building tools that push decentralized tech forward.
